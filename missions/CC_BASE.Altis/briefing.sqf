player createDiaryRecord["Diary", ["Notes editor", "Welcome to First Night! NOTE: This mission was created with a BLUFOR team of 5 in mind, but it is technically playable with teams of 1-10, with or without AI, as long as the Team Leader is a human. Enjoy!<br/><br/>This mission utilizes Norrin's Revive Script, and does not allow respawns (but again, it has revive). Work as a team and keep each other alive!<br/><br/>Be careful on rocks, as they are unfortunately buggy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to find me on the BIS forums as Grimes [3rd ID]. Thanks!"]];

However, we do have some images that were gathered by American satellites just 48 hours ago.<br/><br/>Note the position and number of coastal defences. Whether this information remains accurate is unknown.

Upon neutralizing the defences, Team 9 will then advance through Agia Marina and infiltrate the Stratis Air Base, securing a <marker name='obj2'>beachhead on the northeast coastline</marker>. Once Team 9 signals that the beach is secure, reinforcements will arrive via boat to assist in liberating the remainder of the airport. Once the airport is secure, Team 9 will be extracted by helicopter."]];

player createDiaryRecord["Diary", ["Situació", "In the past weeks, tensions have escalated to unprecedented levels between the countries united under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the countries of the Canton-Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty (CSAT). For 2 months now, CSAT forces have had complete control of inland and seaward trade routes to and from Stratis, crippling the already struggling economy. Little is known about what is happening within the Stratis shores, as nothing but CSAT ships have been seen arriving and departing. CSAT leaders have failed to come to terms with NATO leaders as of yet, and have abruptly ignored NATO warnings of intervention. Because of this, a coalition of forces from countries united under NATO has been created and prepared for deployment. As the first NATO boots on the ground, the American's SEAL Team 9, part of the Naval Special Warfare Group 2, will be the first ones to get their feet wet."]];
